### Build and Test the Lab

* to make and clean produced files
```
make
make clean
```
* to test the lab _(arguments are not necessary)_
```
./program -n <number_of_threads>
          -t <threshold>
          -c <columns>
          -r <rows>
          -l <genome_length>
```
* to test the time each experiment takes _(arguments are not necessary)_
```
time ./program -n <number_of_threads>
               -t <threshold>
               -c <columns>
               -r <rows>
               -l <genome_length> 
```
